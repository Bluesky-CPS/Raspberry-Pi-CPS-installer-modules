Raspberry-Pi-CPS-installer-modules
====================================
The Raspberry-Pi-CPS-installer-modules operate on the standard raspbian and connecting the [Blue-sky cloud](https://github.com/Bluesky-CPS/BlueSkyLoggerCloudBINResearchVer1.0). You can easily install the system on the pi first and install the [Blue-sky cloud](https://github.com/Bluesky-CPS/BlueSkyLoggerCloudBINResearchVer1.0) in order to running the system on.  

How to install
----------------

It has only simple 3 steps. Here let go to your Raspberry-Pi terminal first.

- **Step1:** The module need the Java version 1.8.0.25 at least. If your Pi has not available Java, please see the installation details from Java embedded version [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/embedded-se/overview/index.html) in order to install the Java first.

- **Step2:** Let install the CPS modules. Run the following script.

```shell
wget -O - http://www.bluesky-cps.org/raspberrypi-cps-modules-installer.sh | sh
```
The script will clones the both installer-modules from here and pi-blaster from [https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster](https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster). The script will installs the modules of Raspberry-Pi-CPS first, and then makes the pi-blaster with their installing operation.

- **Step3:** You need to reboot your pi only one time first when the installer has finished the operation.

```shell


sudo reboot -n
```
